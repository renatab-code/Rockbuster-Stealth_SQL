#Create a Subquerie

Subqueries are specially useful when working with multi-step logic:
 - like filtering,
 - grouping,
 - using results from 1 query to imput for another one.
Subqueries help to improve readability by isolating each part of the logic in its own block.

##Subquery to find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country.
