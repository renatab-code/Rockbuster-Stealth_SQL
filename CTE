#CTE SQL Queries

I began by identifying the key subqueries from the original queryâ€”specifically: 
 - the top 10 countries,
 - top 10 cities within those countries, 
 - top 5 customers by total amount paid.
I turned each subquery into a Common Table Expression (CTE) with a clear alias to improve readability and modularity.
Finally, I wrote a main SELECT statement to calculate the average amount paid by those top 5 customers using the top_customers CTE as my data source.

WITH all_customers AS (
    SELECT B.customer_id, E.country
    FROM customer B
    JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id),
top_countries AS (
    SELECT D.country
    FROM customer A
    JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    GROUP BY D.country
    ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10),
top_cities AS (
    SELECT D.country, C.city
    FROM customer A
    JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
    JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
    JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
    WHERE D.country IN (SELECT country FROM top_countries)
    GROUP BY D.country, C.city
    ORDER BY COUNT(A.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10),
top_5_customers AS (
    SELECT B.customer_id, E.country
    FROM payment A
    JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
    JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
    JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
    JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
    WHERE (E.country, D.city) IN (SELECT country, city FROM top_cities)
    GROUP BY B.customer_id, E.country
    ORDER BY SUM(A.amount) DESC
    LIMIT 5 )
SELECT 
    all_customers.country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT all_customers.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM all_customers
LEFT JOIN top_5_customers ON all_customers.customer_id = top_5_customers.customer_id
GROUP BY all_customers.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC;
