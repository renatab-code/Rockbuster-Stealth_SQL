# Rockbuster-Stealth-SQL_Data_Analysis_Project

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world business case for Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental company aiming to compete in the online streaming market. As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with using PostgreSQL to explore and analyze business data, uncover insights, and support the company's launch strategy for its new digital platform.

## Project Highlights
 - Loaded and managed data in a relational database (PostgreSQL).
 - Wrote complex SQL queries to answer key business questions about revenue, customer  - demographics, and regional performance.
 - Cleaned, filtered, and joined multiple datasets to support decision-making.
 - Created visualizations and delivered insights tailored for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
